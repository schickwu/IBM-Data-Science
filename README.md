# IBM-Data-Science-Specialization

What I've learned

- Master the most up-to-date practical skills and knowledge that data scientists use in their daily roles

- Learn the tools, languages, and libraries used by professional data scientists, including Python and SQL

- Import and clean data sets, analyze and visualize data, and build machine learning models and pipelines

- Apply your new skills to real-world projects and build a portfolio of data projects that showcase your proficiency to employers


## Final Project: Space X Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction
### Overview:
Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch. In this lab, you will create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.
